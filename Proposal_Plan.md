     - Use references: Paper on "Expansions in Integer Bases" and "Decimal Expansion Representation of Real Numbers."
   - **Task 1.2**: Formulate and include a mathematical proof demonstrating the validity of b-nary expansions.
     - Ensure the proof is clear and accessible while covering key mathematical principles.
   - **Task 1.3**: Provide examples using specific bases (binary, decimal) to solidify the concept.

### 2. **Investigation of Quantum Phase Spaces**
   - **Task 2.1**: Review literature on Quantum phase spaces, especially focusing on the evolution of wave functions.
     - Use reference: "Quantum carpets, carpets of light."
   - **Task 2.2**: Examine the formation of fractal structures within the wave function’s evolution.
     - Highlight any relevant research that shows how these fractal patterns emerge.
   - **Task 2.3**: Discuss key findings related to the connection between wave functions and fractals.

### 3. **Hypothesis on Binary Expansions and Fractal Patterns**
